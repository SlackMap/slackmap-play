Use your slackline webbing as video game controller. 

No installation needed!

You just need device with web browser & camera.

## Concept
For now we try to build prototype, a concet or in other words minimum viable product (MVP).

We want to see if the idea is right

## Idea
Controll your game character by jumping on your slackline.

Race the car by surffing your line like hell.

Take online turnaments, and compete with other slackliners from all of the world.

There is bad weather outside, go to your local gym, rig line and setup your laptop in front of you, then just play it.
